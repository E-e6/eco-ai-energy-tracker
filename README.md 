# Eco-AI Energy Tracker for Schools

## ðŸ’¡ What is this?
A student-built Streamlit web app that helps schools monitor and reduce energy use. It predicts electricity consumption based on weather data and shows daily usage trends.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why was it created?
To reduce carbon emissions in schools and promote student-led sustainability using technology. Aligns with SDG 7 (Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn (ML)
- pandas & matplotlib
- (Optional) Arduino for real-time sensors

## ðŸ§  How It Works
- Loads energy usage data (CSV)
- Trains a simple machine learning model to predict usage
- Displays dashboard with predictions, graphs, and energy tips

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- Add real-time sensors via Arduino
- Solar panel integration
- Class-vs-class energy-saving competition
